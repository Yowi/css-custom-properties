# css-custom-properties

> Don't doubt! Don't think too much! [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are the best solution to switch themes.

This repository provides a solution for using CSS custom properties with Ant Design Vue 1.x to enable seamless theme customization.

* **Feasible:** There are currently no working examples on the [Ant Design Vue Pro](https://preview.pro.antdv.com/dashboard/workplace) .
* **Simple:** Uses native CSS syntax.
* **Fast:** No JavaScript, no preprocessing, and no calculation required.

## Usage

### Configuration

Update your `vue.config.js` or `App.vue`

### Test CSS variables

```js
npm run serve
```

### Generating a Local CSS Variables File

```js
npm run build
```
